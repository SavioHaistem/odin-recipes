    <li>In a bowl, mix the all-purpose flour, dry yeast, sugar, and salt.</li>
    <li>Add the warm water and olive oil gradually while stirring with a spoon until the dough starts to come together.</li>
    <li>Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and knead for about 5 to 7 minutes, or until you get a smooth and elastic dough.</li>

    <li>Preheat the oven to 220°C (430°F).</li>
    <li>Divide the dough into two portions and roll each one with a rolling pin on a floured surface to form disks of the desired thickness.</li>
    <li>Transfer the disks to a baking sheet or pizza stone.</li>
    <li>Spread the tomato sauce over each pizza dough.</li>
    <li>Sprinkle the shredded mozzarella cheese evenly over the sauce.</li>

    <li>Place the pizzas in the preheated oven and bake for about 15 to 20 minutes, or until the crust turns golden and the cheese melts and bubbles.</li>
    <li>Remove the pizzas from the oven, slice, and serve immediately.</li>
